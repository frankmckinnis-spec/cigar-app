# Ultimate Cigar Companion Logo Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the app logo. In a real implementation, you would replace this with an actual PNG image file.

For now, you can:
1. Create a simple logo using any image editor
2. Save it as logo.png in this assets folder
3. The logo should be at least 1024x1024 pixels for best results

Suggested logo design:
- Brown/tan color scheme
- Cigar or smoking-related icon
- "Ultimate Cigar Companion" text
- Professional, clean design

The app will work without a logo, but having one improves the user experience.
